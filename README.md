In this repository I will share my self-written scripts of lectures I (partly) heard at TU Dresden especially at the faculty of mathematics. 
Feel free to report mistakes!

I currently hear this course hold by Prof. Dr. Arno Fehm. 
It provides an introduction to the basics of abstract algebra.
*Topics*: Finite groups, rings and fields.
Course language: german

## Mathematische Methoden f√ºr Informatiker
Sometimes I also hear randomly chosen lectures hold by Prof. Dr. Ulrike Baumann. They belong to the study path of computer sciences.
